# Console Output

The console is an essential part of the Renardo editor that provides feedback about your code execution and system status.

## Console Location

The console is located at the bottom of the editor interface. You can:

- Resize it by dragging the divider between the editor and console
- Minimize it to give more space to the code editor
- Restore it to the previous size when needed

## Message Types

The console displays several types of messages, each with distinct formatting:

- **Info** - Standard informational messages (white/default color)
- **Success** - Confirmation of successful operations (green)
- **Warning** - Potential issues that don't prevent execution (yellow/orange)
- **Error** - Problems that prevented code from executing properly (red)

## Console Content

The console displays:

1. **Code Execution Results** - Output from your executed code
2. **Runtime Messages** - Information from the Renardo runtime
3. **System Notifications** - Status updates about initialization and connections
4. **Error Messages** - Syntax errors, runtime errors, and other problems

## Console Controls

At the top of the console, you'll find several controls:

- **Clear Console** - Removes all current messages from the console
- **Minimize/Expand** - Toggles the console between minimized and expanded states

## Message Format

Each console message includes:

- A timestamp showing when the message was generated
- A message level indicator (info, warning, error, etc.)
- The actual message content

## Tips for Using the Console

1. **Clear regularly** - Clear the console when it gets too cluttered
2. **Look for errors** - Red error messages help you troubleshoot when things aren't working
3. **Check initialization** - The console will show whether all components initialized properly
4. **Adjust size as needed** - Make the console larger when debugging, smaller when coding
5. **Watch for warnings** - Orange/yellow messages may indicate potential issues to address
