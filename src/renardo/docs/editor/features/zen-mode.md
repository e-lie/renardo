# Zen Mode

Zen Mode is a distraction-free coding environment in Renardo that maximizes your focus by hiding unnecessary UI elements.

## What is Zen Mode?

Zen Mode is a special editor state that:

- Hides the right panel completely
- Minimizes UI elements to the essentials
- Provides a cleaner, more focused coding experience
- Is perfect for live performances or deep coding sessions

## Enabling Zen Mode

To toggle Zen Mode on and off:

1. Click the Zen Mode button in the toolbar (looks like an expand icon)
2. Use the keyboard shortcut: `F11` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Z` (Mac)

## What Changes in Zen Mode

When Zen Mode is activated:

- The right panel (tutorials, sessions, etc.) is hidden
- UI controls are minimized
- The editor and console take up the full width of the window
- All non-essential buttons and controls are hidden

## What Remains Accessible

Even in Zen Mode, you still have access to:

- The main code editor
- The console (in a minimized state by default)
- Essential execution controls
- Tab navigation

## When to Use Zen Mode

Zen Mode is particularly useful for:

- Live performances where you want to focus solely on your code
- Sessions where you need to concentrate without distractions
- Presentations when showing Renardo to others
- Working on smaller screens where space is limited

## Exiting Zen Mode

To exit Zen Mode and return to the standard interface:

- Click the Zen Mode toggle button again
- Use the same keyboard shortcut that enabled it
- Press the Escape key

## Tips for Using Zen Mode

1. **Prepare before entering** - Load all necessary files before entering Zen Mode
2. **Know your shortcuts** - Memorize keyboard shortcuts since some buttons will be hidden
3. **Use it for performances** - Zen Mode looks cleaner during live performances
4. **Toggle as needed** - Switch between normal and Zen Mode as your workflow requires
