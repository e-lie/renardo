# Tutorial Guide

Renardo comes with a comprehensive set of tutorials to help you learn live coding. This guide explains how to access and use these tutorials.

## Accessing Tutorials

Tutorials are accessible directly from the Renardo editor:

1. Ensure the right panel is open (click the panel button if it's hidden)
2. Select the "Tutorial" tab in the right panel
3. Choose your preferred language (English, Spanish, etc.)
4. Browse the list of available tutorials

## Tutorial Structure

The tutorials are organized sequentially, starting with basic concepts and progressing to more advanced techniques:

1. **Introduction** - Overview of Renardo
2. **Playing Notes** - Creating basic melodies
3. **Algorithmic Manipulation** - Using algorithms to modify patterns
4. **Playing Samples** - Working with audio samples
5. **Using Patterns** - Creating and manipulating patterns
6. **Player Attributes** - Modifying sound parameters
7. **Rests** - Adding silence to your patterns
8. **Basic Clock** - Understanding the timing system
9. **Scales** - Working with musical scales
10. **Groups** - Creating groups of players
11. **Using Variables** - Storing and reusing musical elements
12. **Custom Samples** - Loading and using your own samples
13. **SC Instruments** - Working with SuperCollider instruments
14. **Advanced Clock** - Complex timing techniques
15. **Player Attributes Reference** - Comprehensive list of attributes

19. **Scheduling Macro Language** - Automating scheduling
20. **State Machine Macros** - Creating dynamic state-based music

## Working with Tutorials

To get the most out of the tutorials:

1. **Read sequentially** - Start with the basics and progress through the tutorials in order
2. **Execute examples** - Run the code examples to hear what they do
3. **Experiment** - Modify the examples to see how changes affect the output
4. **Take notes** - Create your own code buffers to save interesting techniques
5. **Review** - Return to earlier tutorials as your understanding improves

## Learning by Language

Tutorials are available in multiple languages:

- **English** - The most complete set of tutorials
- **Spanish** - Translated versions of the English tutorials
- **Other languages** - May be added in future versions

To switch languages, use the language selector at the top of the tutorial panel.

## Beyond Tutorials
