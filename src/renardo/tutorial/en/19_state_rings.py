### Rings as kinda meta Patterns

# Rings are cycles of values that switch to next value each time the expression is evaluated

b1 >> blip(R[2,3,P[2,3], var([2,1,4])]) # Will stay on note/degree 2, then when reevaluated stays on 3, then on Pattern [2,3] etc

# Rings can contain any objects or values

## Rings are meant to be used with recurrent points in time

rpit1 = rpit()

#{rpit1}
b1 >> blip().stop(1.5)
