# Style

- docstring for function should be simple oneliner like
- new function signatures and returns should always be typed


# behavior

- use `uv run python` ... to run test scripts or other stuff
- don't write tests if not asked for explicitly
- you can create temporary testing script but they should be removed at the end of the prompt
