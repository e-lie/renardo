# Tutoral 12: SynthDefs


# FoxDot creates music by giving player objects a 'digital instrument'
# to play, which are called 'SynthDefs'. You can see the list of pre-installed
# 'Synths' by executing

print(SynthDefs)

# Each one of these represents a `SynthDef` *object*. These objects are then
# given to Players to play - like giving an instrument to someone in your
# orchestra.

# Writing your own Synth Definitions

# This is a bit more advanced, but if you have already written SynthDefs in
# Supercollider then you might feel at home.  If not, come back to this section
# later.

# FoxDot can access any SynthDef stored on the SuperCollider server,
# but it needs to know it's there. If you have already written a SynthDef
# in SuperCollider and named it \mySynth then you just create a SynthDef
# instance using FoxDot like so:

mySynth = SynthDef("mySynth")

# Using the same variable name in FoxDot as in SuperCollider for your SynthDef
# is a good idea to avoid confusion. If you want to write (or edit) your own
# SynthDef during run-time in FoxDot you can use a SuperCollider API by
# importing the SynthDefManagement module. All FoxDot SynthDef objects inherit the
# base-class behaviour, such as low- and high-pass filters and vibrato,
# but these can be overridden or updated easily. If you want to know more
# about digital sound processing and SynthDef creation, check out the
# SuperCollider documentation. Below is an example of creating one in FoxDot:

# Import module for writing SynthDefManagement code from Python
from SCLang import *

# Create a SynthDef named 'example' (using the same variable name as the SynthDef name is a good idea)
example = SynthDef("example")

# Create the oscillator (osc) using a sine wave
example.osc = SinOsc.ar(ex.freq)

# And give it a percussive sound envelope (env)
example.env = Env.perc()

# Finally, store it!
example.add()

# How to create a SynthDef

with SynthDef("pads") as pads:
	pads.osc = SinOsc.ar(pads.freq)
	pads.env = Env.perc()

# Equivalent to

pads = SynthDef("pads")
pads.osc = SinOsc.ar(pads.freq)
pads.env = Env.perc()
pads.add()
