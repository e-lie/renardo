We use a number of these LFO modulated pulse ugens with varying LFO type and rate (and phase in some cases) to provide the LFO with a different starting point. We then mix all these pulses together to create a thick sound and then feed it through a resonant low pass filter (rlpf). For extra bass, one of the pulses is an octave lower (half the frequency) and its LFO has a little bit of randomisation thrown into its frequency component for that extra bit of variety.\n\nSynth design adapted from:\nThe Prophet Speaks (page 2)\nSteal This Sound,  Mitchell Sigman","synth_name":"prophet","is_synth":true,"prefix":"sonic-pi-","arg_defaults":{"cutoff":110,"amp_slide":0,"pan_slide":0,"note_slide_curve":0,"note_slide":0,"res_slide":0,"decay_level":"sustain_level","decay":0,"res":0.7,"pan_slide_shape":1,"note":52,"cutoff_slide_shape":1,"attack":0,"sustain":0,"attack_level":1,"pan":0,"amp_slide_curve":0,"cutoff_slide_curve":0,"sustain_level":1,"res_slide_curve":0,"note_slide_shape":1,"amp":1,"pan_slide_curve":0,"env_curve":2,"res_slide_shape":1,"release":1,"amp_slide_shape":1,"cutoff_slide":0}},"__ref__":"98914aaac061c1e7d6216b2a1065f49cb9733d9c","mod_saw":{"category":"general","user_facing":true,"name":"Modulated Saw Wave","doc":"A saw wave passed through a low pass filter which modulates between two separate notes via a variety of control waves.","synth_name":"mod_saw","is_synth":true,"prefix":"sonic-pi-","arg_defaults":{"cutoff":100,"mod_range_slide":0,"amp_slide":0,"pan_slide":0,"mod_phase_slide":0,"note_slide_curve":0,"note_slide":0,"mod_phase":0.25,"mod_pulse_width_slide":0,"decay_level":"sustain_level","mod_range_slide_curve":0,"decay":0,"pan_slide_shape":1,"note":52,"cutoff_slide_shape":1,"attack":0,"sustain":0,"attack_level":1,"mod_invert_wave":0,"pan":0,"amp_slide_curve":0,"mod_pulse_width_slide_curve":0,"mod_pulse_width":0.5,"mod_phase_slide_shape":1,"mod_phase_slide_curve":0,"cutoff_slide_curve":0,"sustain_level":1,"note_slide_shape":1,"mod_range":5,"amp":1,"mod_phase_offset":0,"pan_slide_curve":0,"env_curve":2,"mod_range_slide_shape":1,"mod_wave":1,"release":1,"amp_slide_shape":1,"mod_pulse_width_slide_shape":1,"cutoff_slide":0}},"fx_band_eq":{"user_facing":true,"name":"Band EQ Filter","doc":"Attenuate or Boost a frequency band","synth_name":"fx_band_eq","is_synth":false,"prefix":"sonic-pi-","arg_defaults":{"freq_slide_curve":0,"amp_slide":0,"mix_slide_curve":0,"db_slide_curve":0,"pre_amp_slide_curve":0,"pre_mix":1,"res_slide":0,"db_slide":0,"res":0.6,"mix":1,"pre_amp_slide_shape":1,"pre_mix_slide":0,"pre_amp":1,"amp_slide_curve":0,"freq_slide_shape":1,"db":0.6,"res_slide_curve":0,"mix_slide_shape":1,"amp":1,"freq":100,"pre_mix_slide_shape":1,"db_slide_shape":1,"pre_mix_slide_curve":0,"res_slide_shape":1,"amp_slide_shape":1,"freq_slide":0,"pre_amp_slide":0,"mix_slide":0}},"fx_tremolo":{"user_facing":true,"name":"Tremolo","doc":"Modulate the volume of the sound.","synth_name":"fx_tremolo","is_synth":false,"prefix":"sonic-pi-","arg_defaults":{"invert_wave":0,"amp_slide":0,"mix_slide_curve":0,"pre_amp_slide_curve":0,"pre_mix":1,"depth_slide":0,"mix":1,"pre_amp_slide_shape":1,"pre_mix_slide":0,"pre_amp":1,"amp_slide_curve":0,"depth_slide_curve":0,"depth_slide_shape":1,"wave":2,"phase_slide_shape":1,"mix_slide_shape":1,"phase":4,"amp":1,"pre_mix_slide_shape":1,"phase_slide_curve":0,"phase_slide":0,"phase_offset":0,"pre_mix_slide_curve":0,"depth":5,"amp_slide_shape":1,"pre_amp_slide":0,"mix_slide":0}},"fx_rlpf":{"user_facing":true,"name":"Resonant Low Pass Filter","doc":"Dampens the parts of the signal that are higher than the cutoff point (typically the crunchy fizzy harmonic overtones) and keeps the lower parts (typically the bass/mid of the sound).
