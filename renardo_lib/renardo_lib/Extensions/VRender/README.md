# Background
I wanted to add a voice to my Live Coding compositions so I made some research and I learned about singing synthesis, something not so popular in the occidental world but quite popular in japan, with some really successful brands such as Vocaloid.

Looking for open source singing synthesizers, I found sinsy.jp, It is a website made by people from Nagoya Institute of Technology to convert music sheets (In musicXML format) into a singing voice. This is an open source project, I tried to use it locally but it doesn't have as good quality as the web version, probably it needs some configuration or training that I am not aware of.

# Description
The feature basically converts the notes and durations into a MIDI file, then converts it to a musicXML with musescore and the lyrics are added with a python script. Finally it makes a request to sinsy.jp to create the WAV file.

# Dependencies
There are some dependencies in the code, such as python libraries, shell commands and external software I used to make it work, they could probably be modified to make it more portable.

### Libraries

- MIDIUtil (```pip install MIDIUtil```)

### Shell commands and external software:

- musescore (To convert midi to musicXML which is the format expected by sinsy.jp)
- shell commands (curl, cp, grep)

# Usage

The feature provides the method vrender which has the following parameters
- notes: specifies the notes
- file: the name of the wav file which is then reproduced with a loop or play method (Optional, creates a file called "v1.wav" by default)
- lyrics: Is a string which is then splitted by spaces and mapped to each note. (Optional, just says "oooooo" by default)
- dur: specifies duration of each note (Optional, all notes take 1 BPM by default)
- sex: "female" or "male" (Optional, female by default)

A demonstration video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/cgZuO78tVVE) (The command usage in the video is outdated, the interface is a little bit more simple now).

### Command description with default values
```
vrender(NOTES, file="v1", lyrics="o", dur=[1], sex="female")

```

There might be more notes than specified words or durations, in that case those are extended repeating the string or list respectively.


### Example using all parameters

```
from .Extensions.VRender import vrender # Import vrender

vrender([0,2,0,4], file="wavName", lyrics="hey ho lets go", dur=[1,1,1,1], sex="male") # Generate voice audio file

v1 >> loop('wavName', P[4:12], dur=1) # Play it

```


### Example specifying only the notes

```
from .Extensions.VRender import vrender

vrender([3,2,1,0,4,4,4,4])

v1 >> loop('v1', P[4:12], dur=1)

```

As you may note in the example, the loop command starts playing the audio in the fourth BPM (P[4:12]), it's because the audio is generated with an initial silence of 4 beats. It might be fixed in the future.

### Cleaning buffers to overwrite audio samples

If you play an audio sample and after that you overwrite the sample and try to play it again it will probably play the older one. To fix these you can use the command free, to clean the foxdot buffers.

```
from .Extensions.VRender import vrender

vrender([3,2,1,0,4,4,4,4],name="v2")
v2 >> loop('v2',P[4:12],dur=1)

vrender([3,3,3,4],name="v2")
buffer_manager.free(int(v2.buf))
v2 >> loop('v2',P[4:12],dur=1)


```
